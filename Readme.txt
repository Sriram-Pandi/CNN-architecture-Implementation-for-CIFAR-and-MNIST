# **CNN Architecture Implementation for MNIST and CIFAR-10**

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classifying images from the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The implementation is done in Python using the **PyTorch** framework. It includes training, testing, and visualizing the results of the first convolutional layer.

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to:
- Implement a CNN classifier from scratch for the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets.
- Understand the architecture and working of CNNs, including **backpropagation** and **gradient descent**.
- Optimize the model to achieve a **testing accuracy of â‰¥ 75% on CIFAR-10**.
- Visualize the filters from the first convolutional layer of the trained CNN.

## **Features**
- Implements **training** and **testing** functions for CNNs.
- Saves trained models to a `model/` directory.
- Visualizes the outputs of the first convolutional layer for both datasets.
- Achieves high testing accuracy with optimization techniques:
  - **Mini-batch gradient descent**
  - **Batch normalization**
  - **Dropout**
  - **Regularization**
